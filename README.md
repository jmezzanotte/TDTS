# Thinking, Doing, Talking Science 
This repo contains several programs I wrote to automate several survey adminstration tasks on a research and evaluation project I served on. There are 3 scripts here: 
- Stata script to automate the analysis of a trainer survey. The survey was taken by school officials who were training staff members on a school science program our project was doing a study on. The survey being analyzed was taken by those trainers. The survey same survey was given at different points in time, so I wrote a Stata script that would take in the survey data from any time point and run the same analysis. The script also returns formatted output to the user as a .xlsx file.
- Python script written using Pandas to append and merge several demographic files into a single master dataset. 
- Stata script to calculate response rates from output generated by Survey Gizmo. The script calculates response rates by school as well as school district(region) and produces a clean formatted output file.

#Sample Output from Stata Script 1
I have provided a file called "tdts_demo_output.xlsx" to demonstrate what the file analysis files look like. Note, the 
data in this demo will not make sense. This is because I purposely distorted the numbers to the data from the real analysis files. This file is just meant to show how the analysis output is structured by the script.
