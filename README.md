# TDTS-Trainer-Survey-Analysis
This repo contains a Stata script I write to automate the analysis of a trainer survey I did. The survey was taken by 
school officials who were training staff members on a school science program our project was doing a study on. The survey 
being analyzed was taken by those trainers. The survey same survey was given at different points in time, so I wrote a 
Stata script that would take in the survey data from any time point and run the same analysis. The script also returns \
formatted output to the user as a .xlsx file.

#Usage 
This script was written specifically for a project and it adheres to a specific data format as well as variable names. This 
is not intended to be used as a module. Rather, I intend this to serve as a demonstration of some of my analysis work in 
Stata. 

#Sample Output 
I have provided a file called "tdts_demo_output.xlsx" to demonstrate what the file analysis files look like. Note, the 
data in this demo will not make sense. This is because I purposely distorted the numbers to the data from the real analysis files. This file is just meant to show how the analysis output is structured by the script.
